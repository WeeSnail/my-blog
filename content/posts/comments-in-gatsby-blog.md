## Gitalk Comment

Having a commenting feature on a blog is a great options for the readers to
interact with the author and give feedbacks.

When I searched for the topic, I came across many options for adding comment
functionality to a blog site.

My blog is powered by Gatsby, so naturally I looked at the [documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/adding-common-features/adding-comments/) on adding comments.
From the list suggested by the Gatsby's team, two options caught my eye:
[Gitalk](https://gitalk.github.io/) and [Utterances](https://utteranc.es/) The two are Ads-free, Open source and lightweight.
